## Author
* Kevin Lowe

## Purpose
* This is a 2 player implementation of Klaus Teuber's Settlers of Catan,
implemented entirely in Java. It follows the two-player variant of the
original game outlined in this website:
http://nick.borko.org/games/Catan2Players.pdf

## Features
* Ability to play full games of Catan, with
everything from the original game including
collecting resources, development cards, and
building settlements and cities
* As part of the 2-player variant, there is no
trading between persons, but there is still
maritime trading (i.e. trading 4 wool for 1 ore)
